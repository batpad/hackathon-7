## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python or Node.js installed on your system

### Running the Application

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

#### Using Python

If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server:

```

#### Using Node.js

If you prefer Node.js, you can use the `http-server` package:

1. First, install `http-server` globally (if you haven't already):
   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. Then, run the server:
   ```
   http-server -p 8000
   ```

### Accessing the Application

After starting the server using one of the above methods, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see the application running in your browser.
